    <h1>Assesment of Web Application</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The web application server-vuln.js allows user to submit a login, longitude and latitude from an <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/entry.html">input form</a> which gets sorted in a NoSQL database. The server also lets the user query the
        data base for all instances of a specific login through both a query string, or JSON. The submissions are able to be seen at <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/">https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com</a>.</p>
    <p>I was hired to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in working Node.js + Express + MongoDB web applications. An issue could be an instance where XSS can take place, as well as NoSQL injections.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>I first carried out Black Box(before I read the code) testing on both a local build of the application as well as the online application. Then I preformed white box(after reading the code) testing. I was able to find several vulnerabilites using both
        a browser and <code>curl</code>.</p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p>Most of the security issues arise from overly trusting user input. Fortunately, these flaws can be remedies with only a few changes to the existing code.</p>
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>located on the POST API using the /submit route</li>
            <li><strong>HIGH</strong> - users can submit malicous javascript code that will change how a website looks for all users who visit the site</li>
            <li>
                I found this issue by first bypassing the restrictions on input choices by editing the html on the <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/entry.html">entry form</a>. Then in the login section of the form I submitted <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("hello_there")&lt;&sol;script&gt;</code>.
                This vulnerablitiy is a result of an unvalidated user input: <code>var login = request.body.login;</code> The body of the request is simply added as a variable and inserted into the database without any validation.
            </li>
            <img src="./alert_term.png"> <img src="./Alert.png" height="200" width="1000"> <br>
            <li> To fix this the following JavaScript function can be easily added to the server file.
                <code>
                function escapeHtml(unsafe) {
                return unsafe
                     .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
                     .replace(/&lt/g, "&lt;")
                     .replace(/&gt/g, "&gt;")
                     .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
                     .replace(/'/g, "&#039;")
                     .replace(/}/g, "&#125;")
                     .replace(/{/g, "&#123;")
                     .replace(/$/g, "&#36;")
                }
            </code> source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6234773/can-i-escape-html-special-chars-in-javascript">
                https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6234773/can-i-escape-html-special-chars-in-javascript</a>. This function should be used to cleanse any user input. It can be used like this: <code>var login = esapeHtml(request.body.login);</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>NoSQL Injection</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Located on GET API /checkins.json route</li>
            <li><strong>MEDIUM</strong> - lets users see all information in the collection, used by the web application</li>
            <li>
                This route uses a query string to allow users to look up all checkins for a specific login. However, using the query string "login[$gt]=" along with numbers for the lat and lng queries. The Server will respnd with all of documents in the collection.
            </li>
            <img src="./injection.png" hieght="200" width="1000">
            <li>
                if <code>request.query.login</code> is converted into a string and esapeHtml is called on it like this <code>escapeHtml(String(request.query.login));</code> the server will respond with [] unless gt is a valid login.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Insecure Code</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Located on GET API /sendLocation</li>
                <li><strong>MEDIUM</strong> - shows all information in collection used by curl. allows users to continually </li>
                <li>ThWhen the user submits any login latitude and longitude the server adds it to the collection and responds with an array of all of the documents in the collection. This is because the code calls the <code>.find()</code> without any parameters.</li>
                <img src="bad.png" width="1000">
                <li>To fix this they could remove the route entirely as it does the same function as the submite route but contains security issues</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
